# 1. Download the folder "stocks" from the campus (content area "datasets")
#  create a vector with stocks names as follows: stocks<-c('FB','AMZN','AAPL','NFLX','GOOG')
#  read all data in the stocks folder when the csv name matches the symbols in the stocks vector,
#  and create a single data.frame containing all the information, with a column indicating the stock name
#  create a line plot (time series plot) with the daily dates on the x axis and the stocks close price 
#  in the y axis, but only with data from 2010-01-01 (5 points)







# 2. read the df_states csv
# for each variable in df_states, if there's a missing value, impute it as the average value
# for that variable without NAs (5 points)
